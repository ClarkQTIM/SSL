8/16: Steps taken:
git clone git@github.com:huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers
pip install -e '.[dev]'

Command to fine-tune:
python /projects/Cervical_Cancer_Projects/SSL/mae_hf/run_mae.py \
    --model_name_or_path "facebook/vit-mae-base" \
    --train_dir /projects/Cervical_Cancer_Projects/data/full_dataset_duke_liger_itoju_5StLowQual \
    --output_dir /projects/Cervical_Cancer_Projects/SSL/hf_mae/outputs_8_16 \
    --remove_unused_columns False \
    --label_names pixel_values \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval

Note that when we tried to do '--model_name_or_path /projects/Cervical_Cancer_Projects/SSL/hf_mae/mae_visualize_vit_large_ganloss.pth'
it told me that I did not have a proper config file. So, I need to figure that out...

We added the utils and the models_mae.py to this directory.

9/22 Meeting with Jayashree about what comes next:

Finish up the classifier head on the ViTMAE. 
Step 1: Make sure I get EXACTLY the same results as Rakin on the diagnostic classifier (we have already explored this, but make sure).
Step 2: Take the ViTMAE pretrained (not on cervices) as the foundational model and train a diagnostic classifier
Step 3: Do step 2 with the fine-tuned on cerivcal data and compare all three.
Step 4: Create a plot where the x axis is the percentage of training dataset and all the three plots. 
NOTE! I NEED TO CONVERT THE PNGS TO NUMPY ARRAYS AND SAVE THEM TO PUT THEM ON ALPINE

Step 5: Generalizability. We have 5 or 10 different cameras in the dataset. We have seen that training on one and testing on others doesn't work. 
We have two datasets, one with diagnostic labels and one without. 
First fine-tune ViTMAE on both datasets and then use it as a classifier for the new dataset with labels. Do the same step as Step 4. 
Rakin showed that it did not do well on the new dataset unless you began adding some of the labeled data.
